- support all archs
- const pure nogc safe

- Templates + CTFE require a lot of memory during compilation of tests -> reduce mem-usage somehow

- get rid of ModeFlags? Do not help with safety anyway
- get rid of/wrap all the types where zeroes indicate invalid values ?

- make sure everything works as expected in diet mode
- fuzz api

- example-cstool

- support manual memory management ?
