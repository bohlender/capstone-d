- make capstone.internal unaccessible from outside
- support all archs
- const pure nogc safe

- get rid of ModeFlags? Do not help with safety anyway

- make sure everything works as expected in diet mode

- doc: more unittests as examples
- unittests of functions

- why no cs_op_count needed -> count = operands.count!(op => op.type == opType);
- why no cs_op_index needed -> imms = operands.filter!(op => op.type == opType);
- why no size for instruction -> bytes.length

- support manual memory management ?
