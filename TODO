- consistent naming/capitalisation of constants
- support all archs
- const pure nogc safe

- get rid of ModeFlags? Do not help with safety anyway
- get rid of/wrap all the types where zeroes indicate invalid values

- make sure everything works as expected in diet mode
- fuzz api

- doc: more unittests as examples
- unittests of functions

- why no cs_op_count needed -> count = operands.count!(op => op.type == opType);
- why no cs_op_index needed -> imms = operands.filter!(op => op.type == opType);
- why no size for instruction -> bytes.length

- support manual memory management ?
